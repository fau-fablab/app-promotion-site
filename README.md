App Promotion Site
==================

A site to promote our FabLab App.

But the main function is to redirect users on smart phones to the right app store...
You will see the website on devices which can't install the app.
If you want test the redirecting, you can add `?dev=android` to the url or if you don't want to be redirected, add `?redirect=no`.
